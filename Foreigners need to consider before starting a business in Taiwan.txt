first of all i would just say taiwan is
not an
easy country to do business in okay but
i love taiwan i think more on a personal
level i come from south africa
i've done a lot of business in
sub-saharan africa
a lot of foreigners romanticize doing
business in taiwan
to to do a business here is
exceptionally high
you need to have very very high
standards in order to succeed
check the mic and make sure it sounds
right boy
what's up what's down what's going on

enough about me let me introduce our
guests
ander clerk is from south africa
currently based in taipei
andrew is the founder of abled minds

complex as starting a business

entrepreneurs group to foster
support and creativity among
entrepreneurs in taiwan
andrew welcome to the show ah thanks so
much paula it's really it's a
it's a great privilege and honor to
actually sit down with you
i think we met last year march
or something yes we did our first quick
thing
and we've bounced back and forth quite a
lot with
events and doing things together but
we've never had a time
or a chance to sit down and actually
chat and you know that this is the first
time that
the roles are different this time i'm
the one interviewing you for our show
and it's high time that people know what
you are doing here in taiwan that's the
reason
why i brought you here to the show for
people to know
what you're up to in terms of helping
foreigners or establish their businesses
here in taiwan
so first question why taiwan or what
brought you here in taiwan
oh okay um like most other foreigners
i fell into taiwan and then immediately
fell in love with it but
okay it was about 16 years ago i was
living in thailand
just at the turn of a millennium yeah
i'm that old
okay all century people would say
i was living in england and then my
long-term partner passed away
and i just felt i had to take a break i
was running a very big
uh construction company in england
so i decided i'm just going to chill out
in thailand for a year
so as a foreigner in thailand you have
to do a lot of visa runs all the time so
i did cambodia and vietnam
and then eventually it was like i ran
out of countries to
do quick visa runs and then i looked at
the map and was like oh there's this
island
just here off the coast of the mainland
i was like hey that looks nice
so i went over there and i had a return
ticket ten days after my arrival
here and about five days later i just
phoned my hotel
in in thailand and i said i'm not coming
back i'll send someone to pick up my
stuff
i just fell in love with taiwan the
moment
when was this you say you were 2004
2005.
okay and i absolutely just fell in love
with taiwan it was just
but when when did you officially start
living in taiwan i know you've been
coming back and
like coming in and out of taiwan but
you've made a decision to finally
live here when was that i lived here for
about five
years and um at doing business and
you know coming back and forth and then
i in 2012
myself and my partner moved to back to
south africa we had some business
obligations that we had to move back for
and about two and three years ago we
started we
we said listen we're going to move back
to taiwan
and they were also going to go you know
it came out that they're going to
legalize same-sex marriages so we were
like okay cool
we'll move back we can legally move back
then for the record your
partner is taiwanese right yes yes he's
taiwanese
and he's also in business which
really helps me a lot okay um because
that's one thing i'll just jump right
into if you want to do business in
taiwan
you need taiwanese business i was about
to ask you no i'm just going to jump
straight in okay
it's and we can continue that it's it's
really
important to have taiwanese business
partners here
okay so let me um get into the startups
that you have i know you have two
startups could you quickly
we've we've done a little bit of like um
research of what you do you have able
minds
and at the same time you have uh taipei
impact entrepreneurs could you expound
further on what those are
okay well last um last year
my 2020 i started the taipei impact
entrepreneurs meetup group
merely out of frustration to
start socializing with people again
because coronavirus
pandemic kicked in earlier in the year
and
everything got shut down just prior to
the coronavirus i had
three meet-up groups for entrepreneurs
one for students one for professionals
and one for
entrepreneurs and it was quite
time consuming on my behalf but it was
nice i loved it but it was three nights
a week i was
really crazy busy and then coronavirus
kicked in
uh shut that all down and in may
2020 i was like i was fed up
i just needed my social life you know
being able to socialize with people
and all the events with you know events
and um
meetups were cancelled during that time
period and i thought no i'm just going
to start it
so i started the group taipei impact
entrepreneurs and i
i pulled together all the groups i had
before invited all the people
and it just took off enormously it is
it's now it now has like 2
000 plus followers on facebook and every
time
you go live you get like thousands of
views within two or three days it's and
for the information of everyone there's
not a lot of like foreigners
in taiwan so if you get like a thousand
views within two days that's a good
indication
yeah i'll be honest with you i actually
i'm surprised to see the amount of
followers we get
but i also think it's there's an
incredible need
for information for foreigners who wants
to start business businesses and
and startups in taiwan i mean it's like
your book
that's how we connected as well it's
just
it's it's incredible information that
people must have
a need right now we're definitely
in in the space where you know we're in
a position where we can't give up
information to people because i've been
here for a very long time
you've been here for a long time we both
in a startup
entrepreneurs scene and yes we can help
the people and i think that's why
we get we're getting so many eyeballs
and and ears on our
platforms yes earlier you mentioned that
you actually
fix fixated yourself into staying in
taiwan but
obviously the question is why taiwan i
mean you've been to different countries
you were in thailand you were in the uk
being a south african so why taiwan then
yeah now look look
i've uplift in many countries i've
actually had operations in
nearly 60 countries in the world and
business operations yes yes yes but
first of all i would just say taiwan is
not an easy country to do business
in okay but i love taiwan
i think more on a personal level i come
from south africa
i've done a lot of business in
sub-saharan africa
it's not the safest countries in the
world it's very corrupt
it's very it's if you're not corrupt
it's very difficult to do business there
but what i love in taiwan here it's
things are laid out relatively black and
white
i know people a lot of long people who
have been living here long term
are going to immediately disagree but
things are relatively black and white
but they always leave scope for
you know for changes or for other things
exactly that's the reason why we have
this show it's because
we want to raise awareness on what
foreigners think about
taiwan so that the government or any
part of the sector
could listen in and then make some
changes so sorry to cut you
no no no no so yes i think to
start a business here is extremely
difficult
not just from let's say entrepreneurial
perspective from a
just registering a business and getting
a bank account and all this
all that kind of jazz it's really
difficult
it's i think that the taiwanese
government can really make it a lot
easier
i mean even in south africa about
what's it five six years ago my
taiwanese partner
went went there to live with me and
while he was where i was running my my
things and he decided well he's gonna
start a business
he just went and registered a business
it was within two weeks it was
registered it was legal he could trade
he could do anything
you cannot do that in taiwan it's just
such a big migma role it's really
difficult
but yes okay it is possible it just
takes time
and it's frustrating what's what's the
most common
pain point for example that um
you've encountered for example i know
you're still registering your
your business uh you also have another
one right the abled minds
taiwan and what's the most what's the
painful part of registering your
business
well okay it's sort of first of all
the the main problem was figuring out
let's talk about say abled minds because
that's actually a charity organization
it is we're a welfare we're a benefit
so sorry a social benefit organization
that provides
entrepreneurship training to disabled
people
so the initial thing was shall i
register it
as a charity ngo or as a full-on
business
and it's it basically just turned out
that the
ngo charity legal legal entity
is such a draconian system here in
taiwan
it was the the laws were actually
written
about 35 38 years ago and has
not been changed for an ngo
so it's very draconian so eventually we
we registered abled minds just as a
full-on full-on company
because that's more in a lot more in
touch with
current times so for me that
i think that took more than two months
to just actually figure out
what shall we legally register for
organization as
is it uh is the problem more on
you're not able to understand the laws
because they're
because they're all written in in
chinese or
is it is there more to that because one
of the concerns
at least the most basic concern for
foreigners is that
they would have figured it out if all of
them
were written in english but you know
going through
all these websites wherein some of them
actually have english translations but
it's still not clear for them
yeah no no look first advisor to any
foreigner
get yourself a native speaker who is
absolutely native in mandarin
taiwanese and english not just good
in english but i need to be native okay
fortunately my partner is
he speaks although all three languages
nate
in a native way um
yes the government websites if they do
suck
they're not good in mandarin they fine
but the translated versions are not good
they are discrepancies
and remember we're talking about legal
terms here
small discrepancies can make a big big
difference
what i found difficult was
for instance like yes you can speak to a
small business administration
but they don't have a knowledge on what
taxation
that is involved with say an ngo
or or an llc
so you have to bounce from one
department to another and so you get to
the taxation department
and then they're like yeah but we're not
sure what
what goes on in that department so it's
basically a massive puzzle
you get all these clear little pieces
crystal clear little pieces but you need
to figure out how to put those things
together
i think what you were talking about is
someone to actually interpret the laws
and put them in a neatly organized way
because at the end of the day business
registration is
you know it's easy like as i have
written in my book it only takes six
steps from
putting your from identifying your name
the business name down to officially
registering your business
it looks like a straightforward but
somewhere in between the lines are
interpretations
of where your business classifies and
how you should be doing things for
example yeah
look if if you just if you're going to
come in and you're just registering a
straightforward llc
that's fine just read your book
it's very it's it's it's spelt out
in you know clearly and perfectly
for me it was just more about what am i
going to register
it as you know there are lots of
different implications between a
an ngo and an llc um
so that took a long time and that was
frustrating
because i'm an incredibly impatient
person i just want to move
okay and yes that took up a long
that took up a lot of time so talking
about you as a person
and as a south african in taiwan what's
the most common misconception
that uh of a south african
well let me rather throw it this way
i think i'm a rather special case
because i'm
i'm blind and visually impaired blind
and i do walk with a white cane
and being here in taiwan is a foreign
i've been here for a long time
i get very s very mixed um emotions from
people like i would sit around the table
table of table and people you know
people would come into the meeting and
we'll talk and we'll discuss and we'll
talk business
everything is perfect and then we'll go
out for tea or coffee or something like
that and then they're like oh
oh no he's disabled
okay and it's literally things will
break down but this is only more
amongst the older generation
of taiwanese okay i'm not shooting them
down or
you know complaining about it it's it's
just
it's difficult to say how people treat
me as a foreigner because
being perceived as a disabled
i do get very different treatment i get
exceptionally good treatment from other
people
okay i mean i can i just walk for five
seconds on the street
and i've got someone hanging on my arm
willing to help me and walk with me and
talk talk to me
i just love it i'm never alone how's
your chinese
after so many years pretty bad
okay um but i will say okay
that that is quite a big issue
yeah let's talk about that i mean it's
yes my chinese is not that good
for business i will not use
chinese if i'm a foreigner unless you've
studied chinese up to a very high level
or you've lived
in one of the chinese-speaking countries
for a long period of ten years or
something
like that i will not use chinese in
business especially when it comes to
um terms and conditions contract
agreements i will not use it but you
know this
taiwanese would still put a little bit
more of quote unquote respect
if they know that you can actually speak
their language for example
um most of the time i feel like i feel
alienated
every time i get into like a group of
people talking in chinese
and i couldn't uh really answer back in
chinese
so i i really try my best to really like
you know be part of the conversation by
you know giving my opinion
in chinese so when i met when i asked
about
your chinese speaking ability it's it's
basically down to
the basic things like saying saying
things in a
in a not so complicated matter
100 true it's
okay what what i've uh from my
experience
okay so i would go with say someone like
my partner
who's native in all the different
languages
and yes i can i can help myself you know
i can i can speak
quite a bit but the moment the person
you're talking to
let's say it's a taiwanese local the
moment you start talking business
and they figure out that you can speak
some form of mandarin
they totally turn over to mandarin fully
even though they do speak fluent english
and then i immediately feel alienated
because then we have to go through the
whole translation
train and that's that can be quite
annoying
a lot of the vast majority
of taiwanese business people especially
in your in the bigger circles
speak fluent english they do yeah so
i try to i try to push it towards like i
don't understand you
i don't know you know so to try to keep
keep the conversation in english but
when it comes to signing contracts
of course most contracts are signed in
mandarin here so you do
really need somebody you can trust and
rely on
preferably not somebody that they
appointed
you know it's some you need to get
yourself an interpreter or translator
who really knows what what's going on
and who understands your needs
because i mean people here
taiwanese are very very loyal people
they're very honest people they don't go
out to screw you
but things do get lost in translation
correct
i'll pull the questions towards uh
taipei impact
impact entrepreneurs so startups in
taiwan as you know
are like in different stages some are
like at the very beginning stage
in the middle stage and some are
actually like people who are
generating revenues and taipei impact
entrepreneurs group is somehow
attracting those
foreigners who are just coming to taiwan
and you know they don't know what to do
but they only know they want to start a
business
is there anything like a common theme of
the problems that they bring to you
or that you notice whenever you have
your group meetups
it's still every tuesday right or
thursday
okay yeah first test well first thing
when i started the group
it was my main aim initially was
not to have it as a foreigner only group
it's i don't believe you know i want
everyone to be inclusive
so at the beginning we were very well
balanced 50 50
you know local taiwanese entrepreneurs
and and foreigners
but i think because it was mainly done
in english
sort of the locals felt a bit you know
overwhelmed and sort of stopped
attending it
so yes we are sort of pretty much a
foreigner group at the moment
and also yes because my
thing was i just wanted to create a
social
networking event so nothing in a niche
specific market
why i really started this was i i ended
up going
you know i started going to a lot of
networking events when i first arrived
here
most of them are tech heavy they very
take uh
specific niche areas the tech market
you get there that's all they talk about
it's just that specific technology and
etc and app developing
coding and programming and it was like
but
and i just felt like but what about the
other people you know people are working
in education and tourism
uh food and beverage there's just
nothing for them
and all so basically what i decided to
set up i just want to set up a social
networking thing
just where people can come and sit and
throw their pain points out on a table
and people can just chat
randomly about it doesn't matter from
which background you are or where you
from
or what your intelligence level is or
anything you can just
just talk about it and that's sort of
what happened and yes so we started
basically did start attracting people
the majority of
entrepreneurs or people who want to be
become entrepreneurs
but you know people who have just ideas
in their heads but they don't know how
to go from zero to one
i know i know like two people who
started
uh going into the group who are now who
now have their businesses
up and running just because they started
like bouncing off ideas with
with everyone in the group and then they
try to get
you know every other people's opinion
about their businesses and now they're
actually
into running the businesses and this is
happening during the
uh 2020 the pandemic year basically
and now you've you've seen them announce
in our
line group that they have started their
own businesses
um it's i saw the messages
from the one person this morning that he
launched his business
and frankly i mean when the guy started
pitching his ideas before us like oh
no just one of those again now with all
respect i know him very well and we
you know and this morning when i saw the
message that he launched his business i
was like
wow that's that's super cool
that's really really that's what i like
to see
yes a number of people have started to
form partnerships
a lot of people have started doing
business with each other in a sense
of you know one is supplying the other
one with goods or services
or they exchanging technology or ideas
with each other
that's really what i want to see it's
initially my
motto logo was connecting people to
people
people to businesses and businesses with
businesses
so it was really just connecting people
in a very social environment
we are sort of migrating a little bit
more towards
uh doing more talks from
profession getting professional people
to come in to come and do some talks
it is working well but i'm still
sticking to my guns i want to keep it as
a
and i will keep it as a social event
and also what i found when i was going
around to other events i charged so much
money to go to the events and from day
one i said i'm not charging for my
events
versus like why should people be paying
money to network and to be
you know we're all poor we're all broke
you know we're all trying to make make
ends meet and start a business
the last thing you want to do is start
spending a couple hundred dollars every
week
just networking yes and i think
that model has worked very well that's
why we're pulling so many people
every week yes and this event is
actually held at a cafe
in and it's quite cramped if i may say
so but people still flock in there like
they go up all the way to tenth floor
and then you see them like they really
just you know like hug
one table for them for this um impact
entrepreneurs group um i i i need to
pull back to that question
of some of the concerns that were raised
by
foreigners who go to to your group uh
is there like a common theme that they
say hey andrew
my problem is this okay sorry i did
venture off there a little bit as usual
yes okay so common problems foreigners
do face
face here i think your i don't want to
make too many enemies here so i'll try
to
to to keep it short a lot of foreigners
romanticize doing business in taiwan
whether they're outside or
they've been teaching english here for a
couple of years and now i want to
migrate over to entrepreneurship so if i
romanticize this concept
of you know ah it's so cool to be an
entrepreneur you you can work at your
own time make your own decisions
no boss no screaming children stuff like
that
it's the the issues in taiwan
is the the entry bar
to to do a business here is
exceptionally high
you need to have very very high
standards
in order to succeed and that one of the
second
problem which people don't know so much
about
is the pay point is very low
pain point meaning not paying pay point
um for instance like the book you wrote
i'm surprised that it's selling for such
a low price
in taiwan but if you had to sell
that book in the in your book in the u.s
or in the uk you're going to pay
three three and a half five times more
for this
for the same material so that goes for
anything like coaching training courses
consulting work here
it's you get paid enormously
little correct for the same
and that okay so that's
those are two misconceptions that people
have they they
don't understand they don't realize how
high
this the standard of work is
and second of all how low overpaying pay
point is
things uh most most the vast majority of
entrepreneurs foreign entrepreneurs here
they complain okay visa problems are
always
always one though it should not be it's
not overly difficult the taiwanese
government is very lenient to other
visas that are offered compared to other
countries
but a lot of people do take it for
granted they turn up here
you know there are rules and regulations
you know you need to
for certain visas you need to have a
bachelor's or master's or phd degree
you need to have certain amount of
experience
people come and they want to apply for
those visas they don't
qualify for it and when they complain
over government
you know it makes it so strict no it
doesn't it has to keep certain standards
so these are problems and then also
finances
you know a lot of people either got
caught up here
during corona doing a better english
teaching or doing a better teaching
illegally
which is fine they get cash in hand but
you know
it's fine people do it and even the
government knows it
but the government let it slide so
a big problem is yes people don't have
money a lot of people who want to start
business don't have money
another one big thing that i would throw
in a lot of people come with a
foreign ideas business ideas
and think it's gonna work here no it's
not
it's very very rare that something that
was proven to work back in the uk or the
states or south africa australia
you know that it worked there
it the chances that it's going to work
here very slim
it's totally different culture different
people
um also population density
is very different here pop the
population size is different
those are factors people need to keep in
mind when i come and start
plus the culture thing right especially
if you're coming from
a western country coming into
taiwan then it's it's a totally
different culture
taiwan may be forward-looking but in
terms of
forward looking in in a way that it
implements rules
in attracting foreigners uh you
mentioned about
uh gay marriage being legal here um
at the end of the day the taiwanese
themselves are
pretty much conservative people as well
so the culture difference is still
is still is still big definitely
i mean i worked i i did quite a lot of
work with
um bankruptcies in taiwan
and the main major cause
of bankruptcies here one of well the
major cause
is communication that's always
communication
but for foreign-owned companies in
taiwan
it was cultural differences and
it it it's very it can be very small
things okay i've been here for
for a long time i get frustrated
when we have to start communicating
about terms and conditions the back and
forth
you know everything gets repeated five
times over and when it gets out the same
thing gets asked from a different
angle whereas in from my
western perspective it's just read the
contract and then sign at the bottom
so here decision making can take so long
for instance okay that that can be
very frustrating and it has to be done
very in detail
but it's just that's how they do things
so suck it up and deal with it
okay um otherwise i find business
you know like i said earlier taiwanese
are very trustworthy
i've never been put into words i've
never been screwed over by taiwanese
i think if i may qualify that
in my book i mentioned about guanxi
which is basically
like a relationship that you build over
time and i think once you cross that one
sheet
barrier then that is where the trust
happens
but before that there's a lot of like
uh there's a lot of there's a big wall
basically that
is between a foreigner and a taiwanese
but once you break that
you know that's where the trust comes in
correct me if i'm not
i mean loyalty here is absolutely the
alpha omega
it is you have to build loyalty and
trust
and it's not difficult to do that you
just have to be
loyal and trustworthy and literally and
you have to prove yourself
that's how that's how they do it in
western cultures we do job hunting or
business business uh
hopping sorry job hopping a lot and
business hopping a lot like
we chop and change quite a lot like a
resume
from a person in a western country is
just not going to work if i'm going to
look at your resume you're going to like
but why did you leave a con
company after six months and da da da da
da you know it's it's like no
you nee you need to stick to your your
company
and same goes in business it's if you
want to build up suppliers
a supply chain here loyalty is
incredibly important
both myself and my partner we've done a
lot of business with
people in taiwan and in mainland china
and i'll i'll give some of our mainland
suppliers
resp uh respecting that that terms as
well that
once you've built up the loyalty you're
okay your
um the terms and conditions might not
always be favorable
at the beginning but as loyalties built
up
our negotiations become so much fun it
becomes so much more
very very very open to change and be
more lenient
to you so yes build loyalty
don't never i don't want to say never
try to bargain
but stay away from bargaining it depends
on at what level
business you're doing but bargaining
usually happens because
uh you feel like you're in a you feel
like for example you don't have enough
cash
to pay for goods and services so how do
you
marry those two things well okay it's
the way they see it the thing is if you
start
bargaining then they like okay well
you're not going to be loyal to me
you're always going to be looking for
something cheaper
or something more favorable somewhere
else
so it it's a slippery slope to be on
okay in business so i would
the best thing is is to do your homework
really well
from the beginning it's when we did
quite a lot of trading with factories
and exporting work we used a lot of
aliases to communicate with suppliers
initially to sort of figure out okay
what
what's your price what what's the terms
and conditions
and then once we go to them to
negotiate as ourselves we already know
what they would be charging and what's
coming our way
so yes research research research
know what you're talking about know what
you're doing
this is another thing i'll just quickly
throw in about
a lot of foreigners in our group it's
a lot of them just turn up here in
taiwan and we're like okay what shall i
do
yeah you're correct i mean um uh if i
may
uh but in um i think uh this uh
i've observed the same thing like
foreigners will come to taiwan
and don't know what to do but it's
actually
a factor of there is kovit 19
taiwan is in the news as a safe haven
for foreigners
to still allow people talented people to
thrive
and but the thing is many people will
just come in here and still don't know
what to do
see like you use the right uh
term very talented people you know it's
a it's a very good place it's for
eldorado for people to
um talented people to thrive in but it's
definitely the waterloo for the rest of
them
it's we're gonna have a there's going to
be a massive problem
coming soon to taiwan in the terms in
the sense of
once the water gates are are opened up
you know
once uh covert 19 clears up and travel
can start again on borders or you know
visas are being issued
we really really in taiwan we're really
going to sit with an
issue with a tsunami coming in
sorry for the turns but you're going to
get a lot of sludge coming in
you're going to get a lot of waste water
and you're going to yeah you're going to
get your
different layers up to your clean
drinking water coming in
okay and it's gonna have to be be
filtered out
one way or another i get anything
between
40 to 100 emails and messages
every day of foreigners wanting to know
how can they come in what can they come
and do and
you know it is i gave you an example
earlier before
before shooting it it's last week
somebody
sent me a message saying oh he's from
the states he never traveled abroad
but he's coming to taiwan because he
sees there's a massive need
for his business that he's going to put
up so i was like okay what business
what great business are you gonna do no
he's gonna put a puma
shoe shop up in taiwan okay
you know people need shoes in taiwan and
okay okay so it's never been my thing to
just shoot a person down immediately and
say that's pretty idiotic but okay i'll
be nice
and so i asked him so okay how much
money have you got
and he said he's i've got 20 000 u.s
so okay for 20 000 u.s you want to buy
an
international brand the right to sell an
international brand
in taiwan you're going to have to set up
a shop
in a trendy area that money is gone in
one day
plus it's not we we already have a puma
brand in time we have all the brand
people wear shoes in taiwan
okay they wear very trendy shoes
but this is i'm just bringing this one
this example out okay this is quite an
extreme example but it's not
an out of the ordinary one that i get
people don't i don't know what i've
never wikipedia taiwan i don't know what
is on there
but somehow people are very misinformed
about
what taiwan is i mean it's a very
advanced
country it's it's one of the only
countries in the world that managed to
sidestep
the corona virus pandemic i've met
someone
just like a side story i've met someone
who flew
all the way from the uk and this person
has a collection of pairs of shoes nice
pairs of shoes
but when i asked this person about
why aren't you wearing why didn't you
bring them over to taiwan
and the person told me that oh because i
didn't think
taiwan you know would appreciate these
kinds of shoes i was like dude you go
taiwan is actually a first world country
people wear different kinds of shoes
name your brand and it's actually in
taiwan so i i think
going back to what you said you know
just doing a quick google search of what
taiwan is will
give you a good flavor of what it is but
some foreigners actually
come to taiwan without doing their basic
research of what this country is all
about
well it's another thing that i get a lot
and i'll use the word excuse you you can
make your apologies
it pisses me off so much
a lot of people come in even to my
weekly
events and they'll come in and they're
like yeah we came to taiwan and we've
got this educational program because
we're gonna we're going to um
really change the education system here
because the education system
sucks it's like wait
you're coming from the u.s south africa
australia uk
wherever and you say that the
only country in the world that sidestep
the coronavirus
through intelligence
that their education system sucks yes
every education system in every country
in the world sucks
there are issues with everyone and there
will never be a perfect education system
but how dare you come from a place like
the u.s south africa or wherever
and say you're going to come and you
know
change the education system here
it works for them
okay so so the argument would go like a
person would say
yes but um high school kids us
are sitting in classrooms for 10 hours a
day
and our okay with my education system
they can learn the same amount of things
in three hours
yes that's true what must the kids do
for the other seven hours seven hours of
the day
sit on a street corners like they do in
america and in the uk
and shoot up drugs no parents work full
day long
that's a culture here mom and dad's
working 14 hours a day they want the
kids to be at school
that's how it go works and
you know aft at the end of the day
taiwanese taiwanese are all over the
world in the 1980s
the south african government imported an
enormous
amount of thousands of taiwanese
engineers
why because they're highly intelligent
people
and speaking about taiwanese engineers
google has actually set up like
one of the biggest offices or one of the
biggest
um off satellite
station in taiwan where they actually
hide a lot of taiwanese engineers
well so many so many other large
corporations giant corporations are
moving over here
and it's not because of the foreigners
here it's because of taiwanese
that's it it's yeah i think
basically what we raise here it's i
think it's more a minority of the
foreigners
who think that way all who have that
misconception about taiwan
the vast majority of them you know they
here on uh now i want to say gold yeah
gold cards not green cards they're
on on gold cards highly intelligent
people
they here to bring value and have an
impact
and really to help build the you know
to continue building the country the
taiwanese government
has done an amazing job especially the
current government
they've done an amazing job and
they definitely need to get more credit
okay um let me
uh okay i think we've exhausted that
topic in
in in full i want to ask about abled
minds
so i know for a fact that abled minds
taipei is basically a version of what
you have started in south africa which
is
abled mind i able minds i want you to
expound on it and what are you trying to
do here in taipei
okay so able to mind taiwan or taiwan
yeah no it's just it's the same place
right um about mine's taiwan it's a
it's a social benefit organization so
basically what we do is
we provide training to people with
physical disabilities
i obviously resonate with people with
physical disabilities
being blind myself and we provide
entrepreneurship training to them
and then also to give them the support
when they want to start a business so
people would come
to us with their business idea i don't
give
people business ideas they must come up
with their own
and then we'll help him to develop a
business plan
i come from a financial investment
background
so i know pretty well how to get
investment for businesses
and then we'll help them to get
investment for their businesses
and also further support as they need it
because come on it's it's really tough
to be a one all show correct um
sorry uh i know also that
the version in south africa you were
able to make it as big as
1 billion us worth of like fun to help
all these um uh people uh
how are you making it the taiwan version
because earlier you mentioned that
the the taiwan version cannot be an ngo
rather it's a straightforward business
so how are you transforming it
so that's the first question and the
second question is
um are you targeting just the foreigners
or the taiwanese and what's the approach
for this
okay i'll throw your questions around a
bit um
it's it's pretty much basically all
the people we're working with are only
taiwanese
people with physical disabilities okay
it's to be honest with you i have not
come across another foreigner yet
with a physical disability but yeah we
just haven't crossed by a path yet
so we've we're focusing heavily on
university students with
physical disabilities because they're
highly intelligent people they're
independent people
soon they will be free to go and you
know either get a job or start a
business the chances of them
getting a job is absolutely zero
or if i do get a job they're gonna be
stuck
in the at the at the desk right in the
back of our office
and hardly ever get a promotion so what
we're providing is a platform for
these university students for physical
disabilities
where we help them to start their own
business once they've grown
once they graduated and we sort of
introduced them to the whole
entrepreneurship
environment is there going to be like a
physical space where they could go
and we are in a process of setting it up
we've run into so many concrete walls
unfortunately
one thing i can just say to anybody i
have come across
a number of foreigners here who want to
start ngos and charity organizations
just bring a bag full of money with you
when you want to do it because
um we've burned through nearly half a
million dollars already
in less than a year and this is no joke
and we're still struggling to get up for
uh programs
for it we sort of at a point now where
we actually need to start doing
fundraising and getting donations
and it's not easy
um to get back so your question okay so
we're working with
local taiwanese taiwanese people
mainly and
we're focusing heavily on the education
on education sector we want the people
that we're helping
we want them to be able to set up
businesses so they can help other people
okay let's wrap this up
with action item what is it that abled
minds
currently needs or type impact
entrepreneurs need
for to you know to move you forward you
need funding you need help with what
uh this is the part where you could you
know ask our audience
uh we've got a very very interesting
year planned ahead of course things
don't always work out as people
as you plan it but we're gonna grow over
imp
let's just go with impact entrepreneurs
we're gonna grow it
massively this year i'm very fortunate
to have some very good
guys in my team and who support really
really good support
support so what we're going to do is
we're going to have
a huge amount of online
events and not just our weekly
thursday night events and we're also
incorporating a lot of weekend events
what we need is we want people to
participate whether you're living
in taipei outside of taipei or abroad
we're going to open it up to everyone
everywhere do participate
do join us it's going to be fun we're
going to bring a lot of value
especially you know people are sitting
sitting abroad
and they are contemplating you know
should they come to taiwan
you know start a business here or just
come chill out check out the place here
it's going to be very meaningful full to
them because they're going to get a
absolute first-hand insight of what
are entrepreneurs doing in taiwan
so what we need is join us check us out
and participate you know feel free send
messages i'm used to
mountains of emails every morning that's
cool we had you on there before you
became
super famous and um i won't say we made
you famous by
you made me famous you can you can take
credit for that that that was that was
so cool you made me famous
so that was really cool to catch you
before you shot up this star
um i am not famous actually but um
that is cool yes no it's really nice
because
this is i mean our group is
really for people who are thinking of
how can they become an entrepreneur or
perhaps they in
you know we've actually got quite a
number of people who are lawyers doctors
uh engineers and they just want to merge
over from that
very high professional status over to
starting doing their own thing
but we're not sure how to do it we've
got a lot of students who want to pursue
entrepreneurship we've just got a lot of
people who
some people just don't know what to do
and also we've got people with
you know they want to turn their passion
their passion for photography
or video work or or art or level
crafting they want to turn it into
into a profit for abled minds what
what's
what's your action item what kind of
help do you need
i just need the government to slacken
the the regulations on it
now okay now we're dealing with a lot of
issues with the government at the moment
it's so i would say ver
it's it's it's going to be a a pro
what if i call it a love project in
in motion you know it's going to take a
while to get it up and running the way i
wanted
we had to pivot a number of times
and but i know at the end of the day
we're gonna we
we will achieve our goals and what we
wanted to it's just
it's just time consuming but currently
you know what we're moving forwards i do
want people to basically just more to
support us
on social media for instance because
it's it's
really when i look at the social media
and i see the numbers climbing and
people leaving comments
it's encouraging because currently what
we're doing
it's mainly in our camp at the moment
you know negotiations with the
government
negotiations with other
organizations and foundations for
disabled people
and how we can collaborate so it's very
much
we we have to sort out all these
intricacies first
but i do like the the backup we get from
members like saying hey nice great job
man move forward
you know we know you guys are struggling
but carry on you
you're doing great so yeah just
the encouragement is good i love it
