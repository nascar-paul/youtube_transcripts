hi there welcome to chapter 5 lesson 11.
u substitution only this time we're
going to talk about trigonometric
functions in particular so last time was
kind of what happened if we had
uh basically power rule or general power
rule for antiderivatives now we're going
to look at trig functions
so start off with number one we can look
at this anti-derivative of 4x cubed and
we have sine of
x to the fourth power dx now again
just like we did before we're going to
be looking to do a u
substitution here because this is not
something i know how to find
you know maybe if this instead of x to
the fourth power was just an x i could
do that
except then we'd have a problem because
we're multiplying by another function
here
and i don't have something like a
product rule for antiderivatives right
if we have something times something
it's not like i can just do these
anti-derivatives individually
maybe if i had a plus sign or a minus
sign here i could
but not like this and there's no way to
rewrite this that i know of yet
that can help me do this so this is
going to be a u substitution problem the
question is what should you equal
and just as we did before when we look
for u to be like the inner function an
inner function of x so usually we can
look for parentheses we can look for
something inside of a square root maybe
here we can look inside of the sine
function in fact i'm going to add some
parentheses here just to kind of
emphasize that what we have inside the
sine
function is another function we have x
to the fourth
now this is going to be what i want my u
to equal sorry write this
u is gonna equal x to the fourth all
right so we want that to be a u in there
but what about this well if we if u does
in fact equal
x to the fourth we can figure out its
derivative d u dx
uh we'll move the dx over here in a
minute the derivative is 4x cubed and
again that dx that we would normally put
here
we're just going to multiply that to the
right side dx
and what you'll notice then is i could
replace that x to the fourth of the u
but i can also replace this right here
with the dx here that's going to really
be my du
in fact let me just rearrange this real
quickly if we have
sine of x to the fourth and i wrote the
4x cubed dx
next to each other that right there is
my du this is sine
and we have a u there and we're trying
to find an antiderivative
and this is an antiderivative i know if
i had just given this problem to you
from the start we would have known how
to do that
the antiderivative of sine is what well
remember it's either going to be cosine
or negative cosine of that value
of that u and in this case we can just
do a quick double check the derivative
of cosine
is negative sine we know this is not the
right answer we need to create a
negative here to cancel it out
so the anti-derivative is a negative
cosine u plus c
and the very last thing we're going to
do here is this is a little bit of a
strange answer because it has u in it
and our question didn't our equation had
x in it so we're going to just place our
u
back inside here we're gonna plug that x
to the fourth power back in
so u is equal to x to the fourth plus c
and that's my answer and you can go
ahead and double check this this is the
first time that we're doing this kind of
problem so if we were to find the
derivative
we can ask does it go back to what we
started with well the derivative of
cosine of
something is going to be negative
sine so we get a negative negative sign
of that something
and then there's going to be a chain
rule there's going to be this 4x cubed
and you know negative and a negative
become positive sure we can move the 4x
cube to the front that is exactly what
we started with so we can feel confident
that this is the correct answer
now this if we had done this derivative
right if i had given you this question
you know in a previous lesson we know
it's going to be a chain rule problem
and what we just did here is we did the
backwards process the
inverse or opposite here of that we did
a u substitution let's take a look at
number two
number two we have cosine of eight theta
and i'm going to do something very
similar here that i did in number one
i'm just going to draw some parentheses
in here because this is a good reminder
that this is a function that's inside of
the cosine function we have a function
in a function
and that's a sign that we're going to
need to use this u substitution somehow
i'm going to think of that as my u right
so if u is equal to 8 theta what's d u
well the derivative should just be eight
right just like if this was eight
x the derivative would be eight uh it's
not x so it's theta so we get
that's just our variable there so the
derivative is eight and we're gonna get
uh oops sorry we're gonna get a d
theta also right this normally would
have been a d theta here we're gonna
move it to the other side
all right so we get eight theta is my u
uh we'll replace that
and there's a problem though i don't
have my eight
here i have d theta but i don't have 8 d
theta so
i can create that we saw that in the
last lesson here
if i create let me just squeeze it in
right there
right then i would have 8 d theta that
would be my d u but i can't just create
that for no reason if i create an
eight i also have to create a one over
eight
don't i right that way i haven't really
changed anything but what will happen
now is i'll get one over eight out front
and on the inside i'll be able to do a
substitution we'll get cosine of u
and we'll have our d u i don't need that
much room
d u right remember d u really contains
inside of it
eight d theta right it contains both of
those
now this is an anti-derivative i know
the anti-derivative
of cosine let's see is it sine yeah the
derivative of sine
does go back to cosine so we can say
that sine of u is going to be that
answer plus
c last thing we do is we plug u back in
and we get sine of what it's going to be
eight theta
plus c okay
and we can go ahead and double check
that it's always a good idea to verify
this by finding a derivative
if we do find the derivative derivative
of sine is cosine
a theta there is going to be a chain
rule and there's also this 1 over 8 in
front
so that 1 over 8 the 8 are going to
cancel out and we are left with exactly
what we started with
cosine of a theta
all right so i'm going to try to create
a few harder problems perhaps
uh perhaps or harder i don't know uh but
there are going to be some u
substitution problems i think
uh we have t sine of t squared again
what we think of when we think of what
should u is we're looking for
an inner function here now sine is a
function but that's the outer function
inside the sine function there seems to
be a t squared
but while we're thinking about what u
should be we're also thinking about the
d
u we're also thinking about the
derivative needs to be there and the
derivative here
if u is equal to t squared d u would
equal 2t
dt so the question is do we have that
and
the answer is not quite we can create a
2 though that's all that we're missing
if we create a 1 over 2 which i'll
factor out
now this becomes 1 over 2 antiderivative
and we're going to have that
sine of u d u and that's an
antiderivative i know
all right derivative our antiderivative
of sine is going to be cosine well it's
actually going to be a negative
cosine of u and we're going to get a
plus c
plug u back in so this will become a
negative one half
cosine t squared plus c
let's take a look at number four uh now
this one's a little more obvious because
the
the parentheses are actually written in
there's usually i'm the one who wants to
write those in there so i can see what
the inner function is
but what's weird about this one is it
happens in two places we might be
thinking
what if u is equal to one minus x
would that work we could replace u two
times
do we have d u well that would be a
negative one dx write the derivative
there
zero minus one and we don't exactly have
that but we can always create
a negative one we can always create a
constant so i'll just squeeze a negative
one in right there
there's also gonna be another negative
i'll create i'll just factor that
negative sign out
so what we end up getting is a negative
anti-derivative
secant u tangent
u d u and that d u includes the negative
1 and the dx
now this is an anti-derivative that
we've learned
uh hopefully you remember it if not it
might be worth reviewing that
this anti-derivative whatever it is the
derivative of it will go back to being
secant tangent do you remember which one
that is
it should be secant of u plus c
the derivative of secant was secant
tangent right the derivative of secant
was secant tangent so we know this is
the anti-derivative
last thing i'm going to do is i'm going
to plug my u back in so this is a 1
minus x goes in
we still have that plus c final answer
okay let's look at these last two
problems here number five we have the
square root of tangent x
secant squared x dx this anti-derivative
now
when i look inside the trig functions
you know you could draw a parenthesis
here but i just see an
x in fact if you're ever tempted to say
u
equals x don't even bother there's not
going to be a need to do that
you could but then all you're doing is
you're going to change all your x's and
the u's and you will not have made the
the integral any simpler it won't reveal
to you
any simpler structure or how to find the
anti-derivative so
if you ever find yourself setting u
equal to x you know that's not going to
work out that's not the correct way to
go
so it doesn't really work here we're not
going to say u equals x but there is
another inner function here it's just
not happening inside the trig function
it's happening right here we have square
root of something
consider that if u equals tangent x we
also have the d
u do you remember the derivative of
tangent x it should be secant squared
and we have exactly that right there
secant squared
x dx and so basically what we have here
is the square root of we can put our u
in there
and then we have d u right there so
that's pretty complicated looking d
u but that's what d u is now this
looks like a much easier problem this
looks like a power rule because this is
really u to the one half power
we add one to the exponent so we get
three over two
we divide by it so that's really saying
times two over three
plus c and we plug u back in u is equal
to
tangent of x and this is raised to the
three over 2 power plus c
all right so this is actually a general
power rule even though we saw trig
functions here
the real structure here that's hiding
away inside of this is that we have
something to the one-half power
okay let's take a look at number six
then we have sine of x over cosine cubed
of x
dx and oh my what can we do here
we don't have quotient rule for
antiderivatives so we need to
do some sort of rewriting what should u
equal do you think
well it can be kind of hard to see what
the inner function is it's not going to
be x
uh so what is the inner function it
might be helpful if we rewrote this a
little bit
having this cube notation i find is
always a little bit tricky here so let
me write this
a slightly better way this is really
saying a cosine x
that's all being cubed that's the
meaning of it in fact writing it this
way is helpful because now we can see
these parentheses here
it lets us know that whatever's inside
parenthesis is probably going to be our
u
all right let's go ahead and give that a
try uh if u
is equal to if u is equal to
cosine x what would d u be
well the derivative of cosine is
negative sine of x dx
and you can see that we almost have that
don't we all we're missing is
the negative sign right and then we have
it so if i create a negative sign here
i need to create a negative sign maybe
here on the outside a negative one and
another negative one if i do this
we're going to get negative on the
outside on the bottom here we're getting
that
u cubed don't we and on the top we had d
u we had d in fact you could pull that
out to the side it could be 1 over u
cubed
in fact i'm going to go ahead and
rewrite this whole thing here this is
really a u to a negative 3 power d u
it's going to be helpful to write that
as a power because this is really a
power rule
problem we're going to say u to the what
power we add 1
negative 3 plus 1 is a negative 2. we
divide by it so we get 1
over negative 2 and we get plus c
we can see a negative and a negative
here make a positive let's flip that
u to the bottom here that's going to be
a u to the positive 2 power
and let's plug in what our u is we have
1 over 2
and this is going to be our cosine x
squared on the bottom plus c
and that will be my final answer
