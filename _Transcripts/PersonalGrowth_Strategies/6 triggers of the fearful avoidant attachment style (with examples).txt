in this video we are going to talk about
six fearful avoidant attachment style
triggers
with examples
i am pauline and i am so happy you are
here because getting triggered as a
fearful of island is super confusing if
you don't know what's happening
so first of all when you get triggered
what can happen is that you come in what
i call a crash state which is pretty
much when you're
fearful avoid an attachment style is
triggered to the max and for a fearful
avoidant that is very confusing the
other two insecure attachment styles
have crash states too but they are a
little bit more straightforward and
always the same for the fearful avoidant
it can be on the one hand that you are
having the really active form of fear so
the active form of crash day which means
you
just start pleasing and you start
getting
a lot of energy and unrest that you have
to
figure this out and have to solve this
which can lead to pleasing but it can
also lead to um obsessive thinking so
when you are in a um
in a healthy relationship sometimes this
leads to obsessive thinking about
whether this relationship is right
whether you are feeling enough whether
you are in love enough
um
and what can also happen and it can
flip-flop between the two very rapidly
is that you just shut down completely
and that you don't feel anything anymore
um
you might even get really tired like
extremely tired so that you can't even
walk or
talk anymore
um so
it it can be either one of those or it
can be
uh it can go
one way or another i can do a whole
different um
excuse me
a video on crash states because it's
very interesting and especially for the
fearful avoidance
it's very valuable to know
what your crash date is and to recognize
it so if you're interested in a video on
that specifically let me know in the
comments and i will put it on the list
and make a video on that but for now we
are diving into the six fearful avoidant
triggers
with examples these are mostly
deactivation triggers so that means you
are going to deactivate which means
pushing your partner away
and sometimes the triggers are not
straightforward it's not always your
partner coming too close for instance or
um
yeah that that is a very common trigger
to push someone someone away
but it's also pretty other random things
that are hard to connect to your partner
or to relationships or to love
one of those i guess unexpected
triggers for instance is the feeling of
being dumb or incapable or irresponsible
and
it could be that you guys are just
talking about something and you say
something that is not right like you
you're watching the news and you get the
capital of a of um
a country wrong
and your partner makes a remark on that
not even being snide or or mean just
that it's wrong that can fully trigger
your
fearful avoidance attachment cell if
that is a belief that you have that
when you're dumb that's really bad and
you have to you have to be smart to be
worthy of love and so what can happen is
you're watching the news you make a
remark your partner says something and
you just get super angry at your partner
that could happen
and
you don't really know why
all of a sudden these thoughts come
flooding in that
try to put your partner down that
make him seem less desirable that maybe
focus on his appearance or on the fact
that his nose is too big or crooked or
just really small things to
make him or her less than you
just to feel
a bit of control and security again
and it can happen out of nowhere if you
don't know that this is actually quite a
big trigger for fearful avoidance
and it's mostly a trigger for fearful
avoidance leaning dismissive so you
always lean either anxious or dismissive
because this is also a trigger for this
missives
because
in a way you relate
love and being worthy of love with
performance and being smart or
pretty or in whatever way you have to
keep up a certain standard to be worthy
of love and attention
and then when you feel dumb
you
can't relate that you can associate that
with not being worthy of love and so you
start to deactivate so that is one
trigger interesting huh did you know
this let me know in the comments i'm
curious whether you've already figured
this one out
the second trigger is feeling vulnerable
this is a big one because feeling
vulnerable for a lot of fas was not safe
in childhood
and
a lot of fa's actually have the
experience that when they were
vulnerable and they shared things or
they did things or they said things from
a vulnerable space that was actually
used against them at a later stage in a
later moment
so
being vulnerable is like the more
vulnerable i am the more you can hurt me
so i'm not going to do that
so
being vulnerable can be when you share
things and what
a lot of fa's maybe some face i'm not
quite sure of the percentage but what
face can do is that they're actually
very vulnerable in a first contact
so you meet somebody you're
at a party somewhere talking to someone
and you can be very vulnerable i i
remember this
if you want an example
um
i worked at um
a company for a little bit
and
my boss was actually one year younger
than me because it was like an online
marketing
company so it was all young people
he
reminded me looking back on it a lot of
my dad he he was a little bit judgmental
and um
definitely emotionally unavailable and
he just triggered a lot like i i felt
like i really had to perform and do well
for for him
and we were going to this company event
and i happened to be in the car with him
and um alone in the car with him and
during that ride of like 15 minutes all
of a sudden i just started telling him
about my whole past and about my family
just all kinds of family
things issues history
and that i don't usually tell people
and
i remember after
that
that company event i went home and i
just felt so icky i just felt so i was
like why did i tell him all of that and
he was he was kind about he was nice
about it but i was just so afraid that
he still thought i was weird
and that i told him so much and that
the things that i told them were weird
too and
oh that just tripped me up for days
afterwards maybe even weeks and um
so that was me feeling vulnerable and
then going into a crash state and i i
avoided him like
no other
for the days afterwards when we were at
work
um and that's what a lot of faas do when
they feel vulnerable they just retreat
real quick after that
which is very confusing for the other
person because it could be that you just
have somebody that's completely open to
that and and just
values you sharing that and um
then wants to
build whatever friendship or
relationship with you
but you
felt vulnerable so you got triggered so
you just pull back real quick
and
that can make the other people
feel or the other person feel like you
ghost them
which is not a great feeling
but you don't do that on purpose that
just happens because you get triggered
so that could be feeling vulnerable but
it could also be feeling weak vulnerable
so i
also was triggered so often when i felt
uh tired or sick
and
i guess looking back it's it's obvious
that i wasn't allowed to feel tired or
sick when i was younger i had to like
rough it and just keep going
um maybe you recognize that too
and so when i felt vulnerable or sick
i
the
fearful void and attachment stock got
triggered because i was afraid that
arya and my now husband
then boyfriend would not take me
seriously would think i was just over
exaggerating um
would think i was
well not worthy of love essentially um
so he would reject me so what i did was
when i started feeling vulnerable or
um
weeks by being sick or tired i would
push him away i would start thinking
mean thoughts i would start picking
fights i would just
retreat physically into another room so
that he couldn't see me
and i didn't notice that that happened i
really genuinely thought that
me being annoyed with him was something
that he did it didn't occur to me that
i was actually not feeling very well at
that moment
and so i was looking for something
searching for something to be able to
push him away
so when i started
affirming to myself that it's okay to be
sick it's okay to be tired
and still receive love and when i
started healing that more and more i was
able to stay
um in contact and connection
in the same room as him without thinking
mean thoughts
so
um that is that can definitely be a
trigger of the fearful avoidance
attachment style feeling weak and
vulnerable in whatever way
another another fearful avoidant
attachment trigger is
the moment of connection
or a moment of deep relaxation because
connection
is very scary
for the fearful avoidant it's it's
almost the core of the fearful void and
detachment style that
you want connection but you're afraid of
connection so you
pull people closer and then you push
them away when they get too close and
the getting too close part is usually
the moment that you feel connected to
them and that might sound a little bit
weird but it's actually a moment that
you can feel when you're attuned to it
you can feel the moment of connection
so
i um read this story once um in a book
by david schnarch
called passionate marriage that he
would show this moment of connection
um and i might have mentioned this
before
um
this was 20 years ago he would teach at
a school
and he would want to demonstrate that
moment of connection so he would ask two
guys to come up to the front of the
class and i'm saying this is 20 years
ago because he literally wrote in the
book i made use of the prevailing
homophobia to show a point which i hope
and i think is not the case anymore in
this time time and age um
[Music]
but so 20 years ago he would call these
guys up to the front of the class and he
would say to one guy i want you to
stroke the other guy's arm
and
so the guy would start stroking the like
really quickly and mechanically and he
would say okay slow it down slow it down
slow it down and he said there was
always a point where the guys just
jumped back and kind of like got scared
because they felt that moment of
connection
and that frightened them
and the fearful avoidant
has that which has nothing to do with
homophobia um but has that with partners
just that moment of connection can be
very frightening and it could be that
that's just
just because your parent had that too
so whenever you had that moment of
connection with your parent which babies
and children seek out naturally
that's the moment when your parent kind
of got that jump scare and started
lashing out or started pushing you away
or started becoming critical
so you associate that moment of
connection with pain and shame and guilt
and that's why that could be a trigger
which means that you have that jump
scare and you push your partner away so
that's how the pattern just keeps
repeating
and then also a moment of deeper
relaxation can also be a trigger because
your system is just so
used to being hyper vigilant and on all
the time that it feels unsafe to
completely relax so there are quite some
fearful avoidance that have a lot of
problems sleeping
uh either falling asleep or
waking up in the middle of the night in
fear and sometimes even in panic or
waking up in the morning with fear and
panic because sleep feels so vulnerable
feels so
um as if you're letting all control go
and that's what fearful avoidance do not
like
or your fear brain doesn't like
because you feel like you always need to
be in control and always on and alert
and know what might happen and be
prepared to fight essentially um
so a moment of deep relaxation whether
it is with your partner or by yourself
can actually be a trigger for the
fearful avoidant attachment style which
is crazy right i mean oh you're you
deserve
deep relaxation you deserve rest your
body deserves rest and deep relaxation
so
i i really
i really wish that for you and maybe
just knowing this it can help you to
breathe a little deeper and just stay
stay in that relaxation a little bit
longer
another trigger is the possibility of
hurting someone else or someone else's
feelings
so the fearful avoidant
usually has a very um
big moral sense of
when you hurt somebody and when
you don't and
actually i think a lot of fearful
avoidance are just always afraid that
they will hurt people whether they do
something or whether they don't do
something
so
just the possibility of hurting someone
can cause
a fearful avoidance to be triggered and
go into a crash state which can mean
that you retreat completely and not even
try because you are already in that
shame spiral before anything even
happened so a concrete example of that
is that
a lot of
um
the people i was gonna say girls but i i
hope it's 50 50 now with guys and girls
um so a lot of people that go through my
dutch program um
for the for the fearful avoidance
attachment style
they a lot of them have this thing where
they get triggered when they start
thinking about the future
so when they start thinking about
what if i find out he or she is not the
one after we've been married or after
we've bought a house or after we've got
children
um and then when we kind of like peel
the layers back on that
uh it's just well then i have to hurt
them even more so
it's almost like the logic of i might as
well just break up now
when i haven't done that much damage yet
because as we go on um
it will only get worse and worse and
what if i have to hurt his or her
feelings then after we've got married
after we've got a house together or
after we have children and there are
even more people involved
so
the possibility even if it's far in the
future of hurting someone's feelings can
absolutely trigger your fearful avoidant
attachment style and
cause you to seek 100 percent security
control
and certainty
which means you could
really get
really picky on everything in your
relationship that has to be 100 perfect
just so that
you have
that feeling of control or certainty
that you won't hurt anybody's feelings
and of course this is this doesn't work
and that's not the way to go about it
because um you get to trust yourself
it's okay to trust yourself and it's
okay to trust that
between now and then there's so many
more days and and weeks and months of
you investing in the relationship and of
you healing and
um and figuring things out together so
you are not powerless it's not like you
have to be absolutely certain now and
when you're certain now that's like
a certainty that you will have forever
no you get to trust yourself that you
will always find solutions and that you
will always learn and grow and um that
you will you will find a way
so that helps
but that's definitely yeah also a
trigger then the fifth one the
trigger of the fear of doing something
wrong or having done something wrong
oh that's a very big trigger also and
and that could be a state that you're
like perpetually in
which makes it really hard so
there are um fearful avoidance that are
just in the crash state constantly that
are just constantly in that panic mode
pretty much and a lot of times this
feeling of i'm always doing something
wrong um that we actually tucked on in
an earlier video and i'll link it down
in the description um
that will cause you to just be
in that crash state
all the time
and
um
and that belief is under under that
sorry i didn't finish that sentence
probably i think but the belief of i'm
always doing something wrong is is
driving a lot of that crash state um
perpetual crash day so when you start
healing that um
you will
notice more space and more
lightness and more
um ease and and rest and calm and peace
which i all want for you so badly um so
that's definitely a trigger too and then
the last one
um
is other people getting angry and that's
a very very clear one
and
that could lead to a few things when
you're still in your fight mode that
will lead you to fight like you will
pick a fight you will go at it
and be emotionally volatile
when you start healing and you start
feeling more and more vulnerable it
could lead to getting triggered and
feeling that little kid that little girl
that little boy
inside um just being in panic mode
because
getting
having somebody be angry at you was not
safe when you were younger and you
probably experienced that
on more than one occasion so
you
just retreat you either start pleasing
or start
doing anything to not make that person
mad
or you push the person away and you just
stop talking you stop doing anything
just to not make it worse
not make that person more angry
so it could go either way
but that's definitely definitely a
trigger and sometimes it can even
be that the outer person isn't isn't
angry isn't remotely angry but you are
so hyper vigilant that you
interpret that as angry there was a a
study done once where people that were
abused when they were younger and i
think
they were actually pretty much all of
them were fearful avoidant
um
had to look at faces of people that were
just neutral
so
there were a lot of pictures of people
that were asked to have just a neutral
face just no emotions um and the the
research participants that had
experienced abuse
had to rate them
whether they thought they were angry or
not
and to what extent and they also asked
that with securely attached individuals
and
um
there was a big difference between those
two groups
the people who experienced abuse
saw
a lot more angry people even though
they were neutral
but just interpreted
their faces as being angry way more than
securely attached so a lot of the
signs you pick up in being hyper
vigilant might actually not be
um
truth might not be
um
the thing your fear brain makes it out
to be namely
them being angry
and i noticed that sometimes even still
a little bit with my husband who never
ever gets angry but sometimes he's just
a little bit frustrated and
that still is like
there's just the tiniest bit of like
left and maybe that's just a normal
human human reaction of you know
frustration or anger on on your
partner's part but
um
yeah people getting angry definitely is
a trigger even if you just think they
are getting angry which is not always
even the case all right so these were
six fearful avoidant
um
triggers
with examples i tried to make them mess
as
concrete as possible
um
and i really hope they were valuable did
you
learn new triggers was that
just did you have any like
eye openers
let me know in the comments below i
always want to hear i always want to
hear from you and also how do you handle
um
being triggered or what do you notice
are triggers for you
that can put you in a crash state and
let us know in the comments below so we
can help each other and know that we are
not
alone i am so incredibly happy you're
here if you want to know more you can
watch these videos um
yeah let me know in the comments below
