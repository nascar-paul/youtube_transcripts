good afternoon
everyone today is
Friday March 29th
2024 thank y'all for tuning in for
another episode I really appreciate
it this is a beautiful beautiful Good
Friday the weather is amazing here in my
hometown and I am back again with
another episode as I said and
uh this is about ddy but it's not about
Dy P Dy whatever it's
about it's about
misinformation more than
anything and first let me get this
disclaimer out of the
way the vi and opinions expressed in
this video are that of the content
creator only I am not speaking for the
FED CIA no law enforcement agency or
anyone affiliated with the ddy case this
is just my opinion my observation my
view from past experience that I've had
with law
enforcement including federal agents the
federal bureaus or
whatever
because first let me explain this people
give not putting the feds down but
people give more credit than what they
deserve as far as their uh
intelligence how they catch people how
they bust people but they got machine
they got cameras they got wires they got
this and
that but believe it or not cuz I know
from I've dealt with with this
stuff they're not as smart as you think
they
are they're
not it's one
thing that drives all law enforcement
that if they didn't have it they would
be obsolete they wouldn't be able to
catch nothing or nobody
and that is
informance without an informant a snitch
or whatever you want to call them CI
confidence
informance the feds or anybody ATF Gea
none of them would be able to bust
nobody they wouldn't know what to do I
don't care how many cameras drones
whatever they got the informant tell
them which direction to go in without
that they have nothing
so what's going on with
Diddy is somebody
talking but it's not legit though these
are people I told y'all he got out of
line crossed the wrong
people and they Buck breaking
it this ain't just about did this about
Oprah Tyler JayZ and any other big
powerful black Rich billionaire or
whatever this is to show them that if
you get out of line this will happen to
you too they Buck breaking dad Dy
thought he had a little
power they got to show him no you don't
we got your power
boy y'all see this Jay-Z Oprah Tyler do
y'all see what we doing to him you step
out of line it's going to happen to you
that's what this is about
I hear people say all the
time which they don't know when the feds
come get you they already got you they
already got a Cas you ain't going to
beat their
Cas that's when they come get you they
didn't come get Dy they raided did it
what they did was they don't have
anything they trying to find something
somebody told them
something and they trying to get proof
or evidence of what they were told
some confidential informant the tip gave
her uh a tip hey didy doing it but you
know y'all better go check on ddy I know
he doing it what he's
doing that's where the raid come from if
they already had them they wouldn't have
raised them they would have went
arrested them when the fs got you they
don't raid you they don't kick your door
in and come out
with uh boxes of so-called evidence they
already got the evidence when they got
you they just come get you and put you
under arrest did has not been
arrested he just his name has been drugg
in the court of a public opinion which
is a whole
go it's not intended for him to go to
jail it's intended for him to be
ruined disgraced
embarrassed
publicly uh
y' whatever the word put put your big
words in there for
me that's what this is about if they had
him they wouldn't have brought all that
and then look at the F dude how they
came and got him they didn't do all that
what they did to did why not why they
got de with all them tanks and arm uh
military style agents and got his sons
out handcuff them little soft dancing
little boys they ain't doing nothing
they came out like they ra El Choo for
Diddy everybody know didy
soft I ain't going to do nothing they
came in there like they raiding one of
the
cartels and then they put this narrative
out there you know he got a drug mu they
arrested his mu a drug m is someone who
trans transporting
kilos
bundles large quantities
trafficking that Ain what did got going
on did is a junkie like all them big
celebrities and star all them
junkies that white guy they arrested was
his personal Supply guy the guy that was
going to get a stash for him he left his
stash his personal
Supply not no kilos on a container
ship pay attention people wake up
listen his personal
Supply get is a celebrity well known so
like all the other celebrity junkies
they don't go in the hood and buy their
own stuff they have regular normal
people on the payroll that go get it for
them they're not selling it they're not
D don't need to sell no come on now
y'all know better than that your man
ain't got to traffic no stuff like that
that ain't what he doing that's his own
personal junky Supply that he can't go
get himself cuz he's always under the
spotlight he got to have low-key people
that don't everybody know go get it all
he doing hey go bring me this go get me
a 20 go get me this go you know that's
all he
doing the fs don't get involved in no
mess like
that this it ain't about
that talk about the the ex trafficking
sex tra whatever 50 Cent baby mama in
young Miami ain't no trafficking them
folks that woman came out and said I a
lie I Ain being trafficed I'm not I'm no
sex worker them just women that like
Rich dudes
like most
women that's got a rich dude he a sugar
dad and they sugar babies that's
it no sex
trafficking that man too well known be
all over the place
know we cannot be so quick to believe
whatever them people say about somebody
without actually looking and observing
first before we assume they right cuz
they can do that to anybody they try to
do it to me
I know how they do they will have
somebody that you ain't never heard of
or seen a day in your life if they want
to get you they they'll go offer them
people a deal to testify against you and
that man might say I don't even know I
don't know big war we don't care if you
know him you just say you know him and
we going to cut your time by 15 years
all right them folk I know this F they
bring people to testify against you you
ain't never seen
before don't know that you people them
people don't know you they'll get up on
stand and lot cuz it was off of the deal
it's hey I ain't saying what happened to
Diddy I ain't saying it ain't
though but all I know is did is still
free all the show Force did is still
free but the F they got it when they
come when they come for you they already
got you they would have
arrested they wouldn't have did all that
raid and they they raid when they trying
to get evidence not when they already
got
it a raid is to gather
evidence when they already got evidence
it's called being arrested and charged
he ain't been either one of those
arrested or charged look how many days
have been now the Fe so smart what's
taking them so long cuz it ain't nothing
somebody gave them a tip they they
acting off a tip and inform it that they
believe in and trusted all that they
know is
powerful and can make moves on their
behalf
did got a line did got to be taught a
lesson and it's also got to be shown to
other powerful black people you get out
of line you bite the hand that feed you
just for
you you best believe every one of them
big powerful black people they got some
on them they got some on Oprah Jay-Z and
any the rest of like that if they get
out of line it's going to surface
whatever they had and they know
it
ain't nothing coming out by De that even
Small People Like Us ain't already know
we know what that man do we know he like
boys we know he like girl we already
know
that but the illegal thing where he uh
forcing people against their own will
and forcing like you know putting you
know I I can't say the
GW illegal selfes and people's drinks

big elaborate wild
parties parties where everybody that is
into the same
thing and he's
supplying the fun packs if you want to
call
it he ain't forcing nobody to you they
already junkies he just got it they
already waiting for him they ain't got
to go nowhere they ain't got to bring me
on he throwing a party come on party I
got everything you need that's all he
doing he not forcing nobody on nothing
try I don't believe it now if they show
me otherwise then I'll come back and say
how we wrong I don't believe it I don't
believe was going I be all thing
happening did got out of
line did it got too big for his Bridges
that's it all the other stuff young
Miami a sex worker no she
ain't she a young girl who like rich men
like most
women ain't none of us dealing with a
woman for free play so that make all
women ex workers
cuz ain't no woman going to deal with
you if you broke all of them ain't
dealing with million there but they
ain't dealing with no broke dude
either so that whatever they talking
about b y Miami they talking about all
women that's
nature they just don't deal with broke
they deal with me Rich dude Diddy is a
sugar daddy young Miami 50 c baby mama

a sugar babies they in it for the
money

let your hate for the man cuz you
jealous and you want him to fall off
don't let that blind you from reality
and the truth all
right that's all I'm asking just take a
deeper look into these things the rabbit
hole is
deep it ain't always what they show you
if what they don't show you I'm looking
for what they don't show you I advise
y'all to do the same or it could be you
they bring some false stuff up against
and paint you out to the world like you
a devil and you ain't did nothing it
happens I'm I'm telling you it
happens they will make up stuff on you
if they want to and people going to
believe because hey a lot of people
don't believe law enforcement rely on
you plant stuff make up
